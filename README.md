# COAR-Notify Inbox Rails Engine

A Rails engine providing a COAR Notify Inbox.

This is designed to function as a standalone COAR Notify inbox supporting [v1.0.1 of the COAR Notify specification](https://coar-notify.net/specification/1.0.1/), but also to be integrated into a [Samvera Hyrax](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax) (v5.2) repository. It is therefore implemented in Rails 7.2 which is a requirement of Hyrax 5.2.

There is a [related Hyrax 5.2 integration GitHub repository](https://github.com/antleaf/hyrax-coar-notify).
